It seems the sources have been in the article since its creation on 10 June 2019. It seems all three were simply moved from "2019 Hong Kong extradition bill" article so I put the dates they were inserted there. ":0" seems to have been there since the beginning of that article on 1 May 2019 and that's as far back as I'm willing to dig right now.

925186023,2019-11-08T11:46:23Z,KasimMejia,37445042,271014,Saying somebody would "of course" support somebody is [[WP:OR]] and the source you've provided is a criticism of the protesters by the Chinese Gov. That does not mean support.
