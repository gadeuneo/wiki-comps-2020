# Documentation and Citations for Start Date Column in `creation_dates_analysis.csv`
`creation_dates_analysis.csv` is a copy of `creation_dates.csv` without talk
pages and articles that do not have recent start dates, e.g. Hong Kong. These
articles will not be relevant to our analysis as we are trying to look at the
delay between event start time and page creation time.

In addition to copying and deleting irrelevant articles,
`creation_dates_analysis.csv` was also reindex using the Pandas function
`reset_index(inplace=True, drop=True)` on the dataframe. Another column for
start dates was also added. Further analysis will be done in a Jupyter Notebook
file located in the root directory.


All articles with start dates in `creation_dates_analysis.csv` will have
relevant citations below for the date we chose. These citations will mainly be
news articles. We will *not* be using Wikipedia articles for our citations as
they can change.
